# Hello
If you're my steminn teacher reading this, please give a 7.
I wanted to make a backend, but since codeHS isn't like Vercel or Render, i guess not
Check the history of the code on github (i think)
Some ai was used to assist in getting the color scheme and learning certain things, eg animation or javascript (yes i learned js for this project)

Note - Contact form has api key removed, need to add back when pasting to codehs
