# Hello
I wanted to make a backend, but since codeHS isn't like Vercel or Render, i guess not

Some ai was used to assist in getting the color scheme and learning certain things, eg animation or javascript (yes i learned js for this project)

Note - Contact form has api key removed, need to add back when pasting to codehs

# To do
- Comment code
- Complete index
- Complete works
- Complete about
- Remove FAQ, replace with seperate pages
